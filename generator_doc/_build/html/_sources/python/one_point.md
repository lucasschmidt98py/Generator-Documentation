# One Point

The sentence that a neutron is alive in the instant t of time if:

$$ t_{birth} < t < t_{death} $$

, is the base of all countings in the Python core for the One Point Model

Besides, but the Week Law of Great Numbers we can say:

$$ p_n(t) = \frac{ S(n , t) }{ \sum S(n,t) } $$

Where

* $ S(n,t) = $ Number of simulations with $n$ neutrons alived in time $t$
* $ \sum S(n,t) = $ Total number of simulations
